Understand what the derivative is, and why it is used. First of all, to find the slope of a linear graph, two points on the line are taken, and their coordinates and plugged into the equation. However, this can only be used with linear graphs. For quadratic equations and above, the line will be curved, so taking the "difference" of two points won't be accurate. In order to find the slope of a tangent of a curved graph, two points are taken, and plugged into the standard equation for finding the slope of a curved graph: stands for "delta", which is the difference between the two  coordinates of the two points from the graph.
